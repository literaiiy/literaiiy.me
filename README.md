### literaiiy.me

----

Hello! I am literaiiy, a high school student in the San Francisco Bay Area who enjoys working with technology-related things; mainly mobile devices, software, web design and development, and much more. Having been fascinated by computers from a young age, I have accumulated years worth of knowledge but am always eager to learn more.

literaiiy is a pseudonym I gave myself back in spring of 2018 as an intentionally spelt version of the word "literally". While appearing frequently in everyday conversation, it is not usually used correctly strictly by definition, but more as hyperboleâ€” a common word that has dulled due to overuse.

literaiiy.me is built with Next.js.
